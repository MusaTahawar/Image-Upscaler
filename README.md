# Real-ESRGAN: Real-Time Image Super-Resolution

**Real-ESRGAN** is an advanced deep learning model for real-time image super-resolution, designed to enhance low-resolution images with high fidelity. Unlike traditional interpolation methods, Real-ESRGAN utilizes cutting-edge generative adversarial networks (GANs) to upscale images while preserving fine details, textures, and overall quality, even at high scale factors.

## Features:
- **High-Quality Upscaling**: Significantly improves image resolution while maintaining detail and sharpness.
- **State-of-the-Art GAN-based Approach**: Leverages the power of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for natural-looking, high-resolution results.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Optimized for speed and can upscale images in real-time, suitable for various applications.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Includes pre-trained models for immediate use, eliminating the need for training from scratch.

## Key Advantages:
- **Preserves Texture and Fine Details**: Unlike traditional methods (like bilinear or bicubic), Real-ESRGAN adds realistic textures and prevents common artifacts such as blurriness and pixelation.
- **Handles Various Image Types**: Ideal for both photographic and artwork-based images.
- **Supports Multiple Scale Factors**: Upscale images by 2x, 4x, 8x, or more while maintaining quality.

## Requirements:
- **Python 3.7+** 
- **PyTorch** (with GPU support recommended for optimal performance)
- **CUDA-compatible GPU** (for faster processing)
- **FFmpeg** (optional, for handling video frames)

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN.git
   cd Real-ESRGAN
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download pre-trained models (can be done via script or manually).

## Usage:
1. **Upscale an image**:
   ```bash
   python inference_realesrgan.py -i input_image.jpg -o upscaled_image.jpg -s 2
   ```
   - `-i` : Input image path
   - `-o` : Output image path
   - `-s` : Scale factor (e.g., 2, 4)

2. **Batch Process**: Upscale multiple images in a directory:
   ```bash
   python inference_realesrgan.py -i input_folder/ -o output_folder/ -s 4
   ```

## Example:

Before:
![Example Input Image](https://example.com/input.jpg)

After:
![Example Output Image](https://example.com/output.jpg)

## Performance:
- **Speed**: With a GPU, Real-ESRGAN can upscale images in real-time or within seconds, depending on the hardware and image size.
- **Quality**: The model is designed to offer top-notch results even for challenging images, including those with noise or compression artifacts.
