# Load ESRGAN model (use a pre-trained model or fine-tune your own)
# For simplicity, you can use a pre-trained model available from repositories like 'https://github.com/xinntao/ESRGAN'
# For this example, we're assuming you have a model loaded in `model`

def upscale_image_with_esrgan(input_path, output_path):
    # Load image
    img = Image.open(input_path).convert('RGB')

    # Define transform (resize image to fit the model input)

        transforms.ToTensor(),

    # Convert tensor back to image
    upscaled_img = transforms.ToPILImage()(upscaled_tensor.squeeze(0))

    # Save the upscaled image
